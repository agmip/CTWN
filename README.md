# CTWN
CTWN = CO2, Temperature, Water & Nitrogen Sensitivity analysis

Inputs: ACMO files from multiple models, run for 32 standard CTWN simulations 
(see http://research.agmip.org/display/cropmodelingwiki/Guidelines+for+Conducting%2C+Visualizing%2C+and+Interpreting+CTWN+Analyses)

Outputs: plots showing sensitivity of system to the factors

There are two versions here as of Oct 23 2015. A new version from Sonali McDermid was ported over 
from https://github.com/sonalimcdermid/Sonali_AgMIPClimate, which contains new features, but 
is not compatible with FACE-IT Galaxy app. For now, we keep separate, parallel versions until
we resolve the issue of running both on desktop and web app with the same code.
